# PlaceFinder
This is ASP.NET application which consumes Azure Search .NET SDK from Web API service endpoints. The data in Azure Search is indexed from a SQL Server view. The index contains all places in Sofia from OpenStreetMap.org. KnockoutJS is used for databinding.

This application was prepared especially for my Introduction to Azure Search session at Azure Bootcamp Sofia 2016.
